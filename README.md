Zillow's Home Value Prediction for team YIA

### Guideline
- Commit to 'master' branch when you made improvement or did something new. And let other knows so they won't commit at the same time.
- Otherwise, create your own branch like 'dev-yo' for your experiments.
- Don't commit large files like your final/intermediate results. Put them in Box.(So you download data given in Kaggle yourself and put them in folder 'input' for consistency).
- Have fun!!!
